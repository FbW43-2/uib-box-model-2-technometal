        Browsers load HTML elements with default position values. This often
        leads to an unexpected and unwanted user experience, while limiting the
        views you can create. The box model is an important concept to
        understand how elements are positioned and displayed on a website. If
        you have used HTML and CSS, you have unknowingly seen aspects of the box
        model. For example, if you have set the background color of an element,
        you may have noticed that the color was applied not only to the area
        directly behind the element, but also to the area to the right of the
        element. Also, if you have aligned text, you know it is aligned relative
        to something. What is that something? All elements on a web page are
        interpreted by the browser as “living” inside of a box. This is what is
        meant by the box model. For example, when you change the background
        color of an element, you change the background color of its entire box.
